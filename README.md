class:
Python is an object oriented programming language.Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
Python Inheritance:
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
What is a Module?
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
